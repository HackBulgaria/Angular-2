### Tasks
1. Install node & npm
2. Install git
3. Install Visual Stuido Code, TSLint & Trailing Space Plugins (Optional)
4. Clone [quickstart repo](http://github.com/angular/quickstart)
5. Todos app: Create at least two (presentational) components - one for listing the todos and another for adding them. Use angular bindings to share state between the components. Create functionality for completing and deleting a todo. By default list component should show only the uncompleted todos. Create a filter that provides a way to manipulate the list by showing only the completed and showing all - completed and uncompleted (use styling to show the active filter state). Don't forget to separate code into different files and make good use of TypeScript.
